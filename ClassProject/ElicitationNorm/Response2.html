        The table below presents a list of the possible choices available to Individual A. For each of the
choices, you will be asked to indicate whether you believe choosing that option is very socially
inappropriate, somewhat socially inappropriate, somewhat socially appropriate, or very socially
appropriate. To indicate your response, you would place a check mark in the corresponding box. Remember that you will earn money
($10) if your response to a randomly-selected question is the same as the most common response
provided in today's session.
