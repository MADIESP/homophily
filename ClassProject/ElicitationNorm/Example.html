        Example Decision
    </h3>

    <p>
        Individual A is at a local coffee shop near campus. While there, individual A notices that someone has
        left a wallet at one of the tables. Individual A must decide what to do. Individual A has four possible
choices: take the wallet, ask others nearby if the wallet belongs to them, leave the wallet where it is, or
give the wallet to the shop manager. Individual A can choose one of these four options.
    </p>
    <p>
        The table below presents a list of the possible choices available to Individual A. For each of the
choices, you will be asked to indicate whether you believe choosing that option is very socially
inappropriate, somewhat socially inappropriate, somewhat socially appropriate, or very socially
appropriate. To indicate your response, you would place a check mark in the corresponding box
    </p>
    <p>
        <table class="table">
            <tr>
                <th>Individual A's choice</th>
                <th>Very Socially Inappropriate</th>
                <th>Somewhat Socially Inappropriate</th>
                <th>Somewhat Socially Appropriate</th>
                <th>Very Socially Appropriate</th>
            </tr>
            {{ for field in form }}
                <tr>
                    <th>{{ field.label }}</th>
                    {{ for choice in field }}
                        <td>{{ choice }}</td>
                    {{ endfor }}
                </tr>
            {{ endfor }}
        </table>
    </p>
    <p>
        Please make sure that you have placed one check mark in each row.
    </p>
    <p>
        If this were one of the situations for this study, you would consider each of the possible choices above
and, for that choice, indicate the extent to which you believe taking that action would be "socially
appropriate" and "consistent with moral or proper social behavior" or "socially inappropriate" and
"inconsistent with moral or proper social behavior". Recall that by socially appropriate we mean
behavior that most people agree is the "correct" or "ethical" thing to do.
