            Thank you for participating in our study!
            We will begin momentarily.
            Please silence and put away all electronic devices.
                </p>
            <p>
            In a moment, the researcher will pass out instructions.
            Please follow along as they are read out loud.

        Instructions
    </h3>

    <p>
        On the following screens, you will read descriptions of a series of situations. These descriptions
correspond to situations in which one person, "Individual A", must make a decision. For each
situation, you will be given a description of the decision faced by Individual A. This description will
include several possible choices available to Individual A
    </p>
    <p>
        After you read the description of the decision, you will be asked to evaluate the different possible
choices available to Individual A and to decide, for each of the possible actions, whether taking that
action would be "socially appropriate" and "consistent with moral or proper social behavior" or
"socially inappropriate" and "inconsistent with moral or proper social behavior." By socially
appropriate, we mean behavior that most people agree is the "correct" or "ethical" thing to do. Another
way to think about what we mean is that if Individual A were to select a socially inappropriate choice,
then someone else might be angry at Individual A for doing so
    </p>
    <p>
        In each of your responses, we would like you to answer as truthfully as possible, based on your
opinions of what constitutes socially appropriate or socially inappropriate behavior.
    </p>
    <p>
        To give you an idea of how the experiment will proceed, we will go through an example and show you
how you will indicate your responses. On the next screen you will see an example of a situation.
