    <p>
    Are there any questions about this example situation? On the following pages, there are several situations, all dealing with decisions that Individual A, a participant in an experiment, might have to make.
    </p>
    <p>
    For each of the following situations, the experimenter will read a description of the situation.
In previous sessions, participants indicated their appropriateness ratings by clicking the button in the corresponding box, as you just did in the example.

    </p>
    <p>
    At the end of the experiment today, we will randomly select one of the situations.
        For this situation, we will also randomly select one of the possible choices that Individual
        A could make. Thus, we will select both a situation and one possible choice at random.
    </p>
    <p>

   For the choice selected, you will guess the rating most frequently given by participants in previous sessions. <b> If you give the same response as that most frequently given by these participants, then you will receive an additional $10.</b>
        This amount will be paid to you, in cash, at the conclusion of the experiment.
        For instance, if we were to select the example situation above and the possible choice "Leave the wallet where it is", and if your guess had been "somewhat socially inappropriate",
        then you would receive $10, in addition to the $7 participation fee, if this was the rating most frequently selected by others in previous sessions.
        Otherwise you would receive only the $7 participation fee.


    </p>
    <p>
    If you have any questions from this point on, please raise your hand and wait for the
        experimenter to come to you.
